#### [Link to application](https://www.splitwise.com/mobile)

Splitting rent, grocery bills or a lunch with your friends can get quite tricky and awkward. Moreover, there may be times when the bills are misplaced or forgotten, resulting into confusion. A user can add the bill as soon as the expense is incurred which eliminates the need of keep receipts. The math can be simplified by using Splitwise on your mobile. Splitwise is a tool that allows its users to make decision process easier and move towards a cash-free financial system.
Splitwise is a free cloud-based application that allows users to split expenses and bills with their friends and group in a very easy way. It eliminates the awkwardness of asking for money from your friends and it is one of the best tools to make sure that every member of the group gives their share. It is a very useful application for students who live in hostels or rented apartments.  This application is available on Google Play Store, App Store and a desktop version too.
Splitwise is an amazing finance app that allows the user to keep track of expenditures, view balances, setup email remainders for bills and much more.
#### Features:

4)	Simplified chart and amount of how much is the user owed or owes.
5)	Split by shares, percentage and adjustment.
6)	In app payment using PayPal and Venmo for US consumers only.
#### Drawbacks
One of the drawback of the application is that the in-app payment functionality is available only for the users of United States. Moreover, searching for old bills, currency conversion, and more charts are the features available just for the pro version of the app. The person should also be signed up using his email on Splitwise with whom you want to split the bills. The options to choose between the type of group you want to create is totally useless as the functionalities of all of them are the same.

#### First Heuristic Evaluation: Aesthetic and minimalistic design
Splitwise is such a simple to use app with a very attractive design. No unnecessary information is provided as the user can easily learn how to use the app. It just contains 3 tabs and a floating button which suffices the needs of performing all the functionalities. The first tab shows all the amount you owe or being owed with all your friends. The second tab shows the overview of the group’s financials. The third page shows all the recent activities that have been added or updated. Finally, the floating button lets the user add new expense. This is all the app has to complete its full functionality.

#### Second Heuristic Evaluation: Match between system and real world
The language and the UI of the application is so simple. The users do not need to know the underlying algorithm which the app uses to calculate the share of each user. The concept of splitting the expenses with friends or roommates is something that is needed regularly and so the app is helpful for day to day routine. The language used is plain English and a keypad to input expenses. The phrases like total balance, add bill, split equally, settle balance and many others are words which are familiar to all the users.

Moreover, while using any feature for the first time, it shows a glimpse of the functionality of that icon.
